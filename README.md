# Flostr

Cross-platform Nostr client written in Flutter.

## QNAY (Questions Nobody Asked Yet)

### What is Flostr?

Currently, it's just a collection of code intended for learning and experimenting with the nostr-protocol. However, I have plans to develop it into my primary nostr client within the next month or so.

### Why Flostr and what does it mean?

why: Because the dotcom domain was available ðŸ˜…

what: I haven't decided what it means yet but my first though was the combination of Flutter with Nostr. While I find that option appealing but I also thought of FLOSS + Nostr (FLOSS = Free Libre Open-Source Software) which I personally find even more appealing.

### Why u no screenshots?

It's not pretty and functional enough yet.
